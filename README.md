## Gesture Recognition

### Problem Statement:

You are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company that manufactures state-of-the-art smart televisions. The objective is to develop a cool feature for the smart TV that can recognize five different gestures performed by the user, enabling them to control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV, and each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

- Thumbs up: Increase the volume üëçüîä
- Thumbs down: Decrease the volume üëéüîâ
- Left swipe: 'Jump' backward 10 seconds ‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚è™
- Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds ‚û°Ô∏è‚è©
- Stop: Pause the movie ü§ö‚è∏Ô∏è

The training data consists of several hundred videos categorized into one of the five classes. Each video, typically 2-3 seconds long, is divided into a sequence of 30 frames (images). These videos have been recorded by various people performing one of the five gestures in front of a webcam, similar to what the smart TV will use.
